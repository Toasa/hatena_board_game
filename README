how to play

This is 2 player game You(1P) and COM(2P).
To get a number each other,
and finally the player wins who have total-points(sum of the getting numbers) greater.

There is only one rule when getting a number.
When you are 1P then you have to choose a number which is horizontal position of selecter(printing X).
Conversely 2P have to choose a vertical place number of selecter.
After player get a number from one position, the selecter have to move that position.

Here is one example.
Current board state is below(initial state).
The turn is 1p and selecter is in b3.
Therefore you are able to move a3, c3, d3 or e3.
